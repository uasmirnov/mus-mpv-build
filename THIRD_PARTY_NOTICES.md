# Third-party notices

The MIT License in [LICENSE](LICENSE) applies only to material authored for
this repository, including its build scripts, CI workflows, Dockerfiles,
configuration files, and documentation, unless otherwise stated.

It does not relicense third-party software downloaded, built, linked, or
redistributed by this project. Each third-party component remains subject to
its own license terms.

## Runtime components built from source

The revisions of the runtime components below and of `mpv-build`, the
build-time orchestration input, are recorded in
[`build-config/source.env`](build-config/source.env). Builder-only tools,
including NASM, Python and Meson, are installed or configured in the
Dockerfiles and are not runtime artifact components.

The current mpv configuration does not disable mpv's GPL build mode, so the
distributed mpv executable is GPL-2.0-or-later. The FFmpeg configuration does
not enable FFmpeg's GPL or nonfree modes.

## Other shared libraries

Release archives may also contain dynamically linked shared libraries copied
from the selected target's Debian build environment. Those libraries remain
under their own licenses. The table above covers runtime components built from
source and is not an exhaustive inventory of system-provided libraries.

The revision links above provide traceability, but do not replace any source
code, attribution, or license-text obligations that apply when redistributing
binary artifacts. A matching source and license manifest should accompany
future binary releases.
